# MeetSpot MVP

A working two-person meeting-place recommender using live Google Maps Platform
data. It geocodes two starting points, searches real places, calculates journeys
for both people, filters by maximum journey time, and ranks fair options.

## Live demo

**https://meetspot--meetspot-production.us-east4.hosted.app/**

## Run

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Put the **MeetSpot Backend** key in `.env`.
3. Install and start:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

Required enabled APIs:

- Places API (New)
- Routes API
- Weather API

The browser key is not needed in this first version because recommendations link
to Google Maps rather than embedding a map.

Production hosting uses the OpenNext bundle and the tracked `wrangler.jsonc`
runtime configuration.

## Android app

`android/` is a native Kotlin + Jetpack Compose client with the same
functionality as the web app (two-person search, Firebase-backed group rooms,
profile with Google sign-in and Timeline processing), talking to this same
backend and Firebase project. See [android/README.md](android/README.md) for
setup, build, and test instructions.
